## Languages

The following languages are among those spoken in Zerocity:

* **Chlang** - the common tongue, predominantly street slang, pronounced "shlang"
* **Pyramidal Visitor** - the obscure language of the aliens who built The Pyramid
* **English** - spoken by interlopers and fictional characters inside The Folding City (even those who are not English - The Folding City Tourist Board translates the speech of everyone inside its borders into English, then charges tourists a nominal fee for the brain module which translates from English to Chlang)
* **Hymenopteran Trade Tongue** - spoken by the Hymenopteran Traders, a fussy clicking language, particularly efficient for describing goods, contracts and prices
