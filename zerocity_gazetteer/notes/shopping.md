It's understandable that Troika! doesn't provide any rules for shopping: each character receives an equipment kit at creation, and material possessions probably make little sense in the spheres. However, I know that my players will want to go shopping at some point, so have prepared some rules to make this as painless (for me) and confusing (for them) as possible, reflecting the difficulty of making sense of life in Zerocity.

The hymenopteran traders have trade in Zerocity sewn up. They are notoriously impatient and short-tempered.

In game terms, this means that players (not PCs) are limited in how long they can spend shopping before prices go up and/or the trader loses their patience. Players have full access to the item list (see below) at all times. It can be assumed that anything on that list is readily available, somewhere.

However, in-game time spent shopping should be limited to `N` minute blocks, where `N` is the length of time it takes you, as GM, to get bored with your players going shopping. In my case, `N=2`.

After `N` minutes elapses, the price of all items doubles; after another `N` minutes, it doubles again; after `N` more minutes, the trader becomes so agitated that they are likely to either leave (1-4 on 1d6) or start a fight (5-6) with the customer. This means that the amount of time spent shopping in a session is limited to at most `N*3` minutes (6 minutes, in my case).

If a player tries to game this, enforce a 24 hour period between shopping trips. If they insist on trying to go shopping more frequently, they should expect to be attacked on approaching a trader. The hymenopterans will also band together when one of them is attacked (they live in nests, after all), so feel free to pile on a whole army if the players get uppity and try to kill a trader to steal their wares.
