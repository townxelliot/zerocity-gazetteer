16. Oobla - goblins have been wiped out; this leaves a hole in the ecosystem; also removes low-level scourge for trainee adventurers; also leaves no one around to act as a target for vengeance, for all those wronged by goblins. The Oobla were designed to fill this niche. They are are as intellectually limited as goblins, but have the additional burden of needing to learn sufficient goblin lore from vast tomes to be able to act their role in the world. An Oobla will often be found struggling to grasp the content of an obscure book about goblin mythology to better enact the role of "goblin" in Zerocity. They are essentially creatures grown to take the place of goblins in this world, but (not being goblins) they have to act like goblins as much as possible.
