### 13. Silver-plated Sigilant

The Despotic Order of Sigilants lays claim to the depths of the Abyss. Their bright armoured skin facilitates diplomacy in the biege twilight therein: the brighter the armour, the grander the officer. While their silver flying thrones enable them to cross vast distances with ease, they can give rise to a certain lethargy of spirit, manifested as a coppery taint in the visage of waning Sigilants. Those who avoid ennui exchange *sigils*, employed in manipulation of weak-willed, sheep-like subjects.
