### 14. Word Egg Violator

The Saussure bird of the Hyper Bole forest is a biological weapon left behind by a forgotten war. Now that their natural enemies are dead, these creatures have become pests, preying on language-speaking creatures everywhere. They mostly absorb speech from the air, but have been known to extract language centres direct from the skulls of weaker animals. The grammatical spoils of this enterprise fill the word eggs which nourish the next generation of birds.

You are known to the Saussure birds as Violator. You have spent years tracking and trapping them. You wield a vicious spear used to pierce word eggs; escaping speech is captured in your Grammaticon, to be sold on legal syntax markets or illegal slang ones. By now, you have heard enough speech to last a lifetime and are reticent to add to the noise, despite your proficiency with several languages.
