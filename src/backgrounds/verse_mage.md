### 12. Verse Mage

Magic is the gift of 17 taciturn entities from beyond the spheres. They detest chatter: those who are profligate with words will never learn their secrets. During your years of listening in their baffling Pyramid, you quietly persuaded them to share their power. One succinct and hard-won spell, captured each day in 17 syllables, is now your gift to others.

#### Possessions

* Elaborate, baggy, impractical robes
* Bejewelled ritual aural sensors
* 1d6 fruits of the Pyramid (count as rations)

#### Advanced skills

* 4 Spell - Random
* 2 Awareness
* 2 Language - Pyramidal Visitor
* 2 Poetic Composition
* 2 Second Sight
* 1 Run

#### Special

Each day at dawn, you may compose a 17 syllable verse (a 5-7-5 haiku is suitable) to empower your single spell. This grants a +1 or +2 bonus to your skill with your Spell, depending on its poetic potency. You are able to cast your spell without such a verse, though it may displease the taciturn entities.
