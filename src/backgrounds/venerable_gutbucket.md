### 15. Venerable Gutbucket of the Church of Pork

You are a hedonistic photosynthetic priest sporting a magnificent viridian paunch. Your singular religious order, The Church of Pork, venerates consumption of everything, especially expensive manufactured goods: by such means is reality tamed. This feat is made possible by your intimidating mechanical jaw. As food grants you no nutritional benefit, you instead photosynthesise the light of dying suns through leafy appendages.

#### Special

Consumption by mouth is purely devotional for members of your church and regarded as prayer: the more expensive things you consume, the holier you become. Consequently, your digestive system has been adapted to dissolve precious metals and gems, as well as plastics and wood. Instead of rations, you have the same number of small manufactured items (e.g. watches, camera obscura, compasses, cutlery), intended for consumption but providing no nutritional benefit.

You may eat normal food, though you don't require it. Instead, you subsist on sunlight. You need to sit in the sun to heal (rather than sleep), regaining 1d6 Stamina for each 4 hours of sunlight you absorb.

Once per day, if you consume stuff worth at least 5 silver pence and successfully test Gluttony, your devotion is recognised by the Lord of Pork and you are granted a boon (roll 1d6):

1. Restore one point of Luck
2. Unexpectedly find one small manufactured item worth around 5-10 silver pence
3. You are struck by an intense beam of sunlight, even in a place without sun; you may restore 1d6 points of Stamina if you have lost any
4. A piece of pork or bacon appears, perhaps as an omen; this may be eaten as a ration
5. A smell of bacon fills the air; this may distract creatures who would eat bacon (though there is no bacon)
6. Some other meat-based intervention occurs, good or otherwise, as devised by the GM; for example, a spectral pork chop appears and leads the way; a sausage says hello
