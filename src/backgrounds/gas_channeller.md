### 11. Gas Channeller

Whether for anaesthetising patients in the Flesh Zone or powering the Hag Acid Tower, Zerocity needs gas. You are one of the chancers who taps into this need, venturing Outside to find desirable gases, then channelling them to designated target locations via the monster-infested underworld.

Open air and gargantuan buildings Above terrify you. Fortunately, the Guild keeps you busy in the echoing smoky wetness Beneath. It is lonely down there, but a hat makes good company.

#### Special

The gas filters in your nostrils make you immune to the effects of inhaled smoke or gas. These filters are only available to members of the Gas Channellers Guild. You can still drown in liquid.

#### Random Gas Canister table

Note: Gases do not affect entities without respiratory systems, such as simulacra, dolls, silicon entities, or certain gods.

Roll 1d6:

1. **Dream Gas:** Anyone within 6 metres who fails to Test their Luck is taken to a hallucinatory realm or possibly a different sphere. This effectively paralyses them for 3 minutes as their mind explores. Entities immune to mind alteration are not affected.
2. **Stink Gas:** Anyone within 6 metres who fails to Test their Luck is racked with nausea, vomiting profusely. All skills for that entity are reduced by 1 for the next 3 minutes.
3. **Sleep Gas:** Anyone within 6 metres falls asleep unless they Test their Luck.
4. **Poison Gas:** Acts as a random poison (roll on the Poison advanced skill table), affecting anyone within 6 metres. If you roll a 2 on the poison table, all weapons within 6 metres, friendly or otherwise, count as having poison applied.
5. **Bang Gas:** If lit, the canister explodes. Anyone within 6 metres must Test their Luck or take damage as if hit by a Large Beast.
6. **Plasmic Gas:** Can be used as a plasmic core (including ingestion by a wizard). If left open and allowed to empty, everyone within 6 metres must roll on the Oops table.

A plethora of other gases are available, so amend this table as you see fit.
