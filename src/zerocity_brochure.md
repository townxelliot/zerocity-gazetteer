## Why choose Zerocity?

<image src="./images/hag_acid_tower_detail.png" class="float-left" title="Detail of the Hag Acid Tower">

Arguably The Country's most dynamic and thrilling industrial metropolis, Zerocity is also one of the most surprising. Each day, new buildings spawn in the ever-mutating landscape, nestling in a skyline of oblique palaces and historic buildings such as The Nest, The Brain Dawn Clock, and The White Cage.

Crumbling and desiccated it may be, but the city has style and survival instinct. Here, in 'the city that never breathes', you'll encounter so many dangerous and incomprehensible occurrences that you're likely to return with your life in tatters!

## A choice of hotels - select your area!

### 1. The Hub - explore the nature of time

At the heart of the city, The Hub embraces the delicate architecture of the Fossil Zone, with its world-famous alien-built Pyramid. Inside The Pyramid there is a very real sense of impending danger. The central chamber is alive with a circus of unusual entertainers and supplicants, offering everything from disembowellings to platitudes.

From The Pyramid, countless picturesque skypaths lead into the central time dilation zone. Here, the world famous Alley Mass Generator has the unusual effect of slowing down the passage of time. Step into the field and watch your children grow old before your eyes! Or stroll the wide avenues, where light echoes of other travellers hang suspended in gravity wells.

### 2. The Forest of Hyper Boles - fragments of other dimensions

Zerocity has a reputation as an ugly ghetto, but the reality is far from this distorted image. Surrounded by mellow hills, The Forest is a testament to the beauty of the city, and is home to the wonderfully ornate n-dimensional hypertrees. Over 100 metres tall, these miraculous extensions of other spheres into our own are a must see. The bole of each tree contains a space-time fragment that is an abstraction from one fragment of this sphere.

See the popular and hysterical Nail Universe, and your life will never be the same again!

### 3. The Four Palaces - gateway to discovery

Within a 10 minute stroll of The Citadel of Germs, yet still several miles from water, The Four Palaces are fine, modern structures overlooking The Mirror Valley. Obligatory meals apply at all times of the day.

**The Palace of Seed** is the most pleasant of The Four Palaces, with easy access to public executions and awe-inspiring art deco festivals. Fetishes are provided most weekends in the Paralysed Ballrooms.

Or experience **The Palace of Gas**, taking time to explore its bubbling sphincters and almost surreal gouts of flame. There are many sealed chambers, wire enclosures and an abundance of unnatural deaths in the surrounding area.

A visit to **The Palace of Dolls** takes you into one of the most nauseating atmospheres you are ever likely to encounter. This is a building with only three walls, the fourth side left open to the excrutiating Mirror Valley. Meet many doppelgangers of yourself, reflected by the mirrors and made flesh by insane multi-media robots. Visit The Xerox Chamber, and see your mutated copies being grown in pustular hormone beds.

For the senile traveller, **The Palace of Neurons** offers a wide range of services whilst retaining a friendly atmosphere. Local facilities include euthanasia booths, brain stripping, and mind conditioning. Worth a visit if only to enjoy a temporary feeling of mental instability.

### 4. The Folding City - mind-expanding heterotopia

Since being designated The Zone of Endless Creativity, The Folding City has undergone a dramatic refurbishment, with many of its historical components being replaced by fictional ones. But this is not a microcity without history! There is history everywhere, from the thriving Globe Theatre, through to the Colloseum and the Louvre. The Folding City is also temporary home to many phasing monuments, including the Golden Gate Bridge, Buckingham Palace and the Eiffel Tower.

All the major celebrities pass through this fracture in space-time, including Mickey Mouse and Ronald MacDonald, both particular favourites with the children. Try to see the pained expression of ex-American presidents as they struggle to break free of their squirmholes. The miraculous psychotropic atmosphere will revitalise even the most jaded occipital lobe, delightfully drawing characters from all times and places into this remarkable geometrodynamic matrix.

### 5. The Abyss - paradoxical flux

Located by the terrifying bulk of Terminal, the atmospheric Abyss is situated in acres of glass desert, 10 minutes by pubic transport to The Spine. The result is more bad than good, a mysterious lack of permanence exuding from the shimmering plains.

Skim over the glass desert in a flitter to arrive at the aching chasm of the Abyss itself. Peer into the bottom and see another Zerocity, every detail perfect. Then hire a powerful telescope and try to find yourself within the replica city, peering into a replica Abyss. At the bottom of each replica Abyss is another city, with its own Abyss, ad infinitum. Why not try to resolve the enigma of which city is real?

### 6. The Flesh Zone - magnet for pilgrims

Built haphazardly on a foundation of skeletons, The Flesh Zone is a treat for the ghoul. Without question even more fascinating since the establishment of The Church of Pork, this delightful region is a fairy tale of bio-experimental labs, living machinery and grotesque monuments to meat.

Almost all the famous sites can be reached on foot, mainly by spinal conveyor belts: The Living Cranes, The Arc of Flesh, The Oedipus Complex. Take a lift to GENTEX Labs, order a new child with flippers, and enjoy panoramic views of The Spine as it winds its slimy way across the bone fields. Every meal is accompanied by the haunting chants of the Green Acolytes.

Peccadillos are also well catered for by The Fun Lab, where any distended configuration of human tissue can be grown on demand.

### 7. Eye Candy Castle - ultimate expression of consumerism

Not a castle in the traditional sense, this monumental folly serves no purpose whatsoever. It is a friendly, familiar architectural monstrosity, designed and built by idiots. Inside, the decor combines tawdry old world charm with modern distractions, encouraging the weary traveller to dissolve into the meaningless banality of manufacture.

Every visitor has a courtesy input socket fitted, enabling media drivel to be piped directly into the brain at all times. Other distortions of truth occur via the magnificient surround screens which pollute the castle. In the evening, dozens of superb but useless shiny objects trickle from spouts, giving a false promise of wealth. Watch the inhabitants of the castle, notoriously fond of defecating where they sit, unable to move due to their catatonic states. A frequent castle tour will do nothing to enlighten you.
