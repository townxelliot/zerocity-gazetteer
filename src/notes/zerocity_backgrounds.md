12. Verse Mage (DONE)
13. Silver-Plated Sigilant (DONE)
14. Violator of Word Eggs (DONE)
15. Venerable Gutbucket of the Church of Pork (DONE)

16. Sociopathic Clown Having an Identity Crisis (one for Brandon) - gains power from randomness
21. Cadington Rogue
22. OObla - goblins have been wiped out; this leaves a hole in the ecosystem; also removes low-level opponents for trainee adventurers; also leaves no one around to act as a target for vengeance, for all those wronged by goblins. The Oobla were grown to fill this niche. They are are as intellectually limited as goblins, but have the additional burden of needing to learn sufficient goblin lore from vast tomes to be able to take their place in the world. An Oobla will often be found struggling to grasp the content of an obscure book about goblin mythology to better enact the role of "goblin" in Zerocity. They are essentially creatures grown to take the place of goblins in this world, but (not being goblins) they have to act like goblins as much as possible.

* Shitcase (You are a briefcase full of sentient shit)
* Crow (If we want to eat in Watten Etta, we must catch a crow carrying bread in its beak and tear the bread from it. Crows run the economy. Sometimes, they resist having their bread stolen; mostly, they are as lack-lustre as we are and flap drunkenly away. What does a crow look like? A tramp's scarf in the wind. A skirt. A calligraphic symbol for boredom. A hole in a shattered window.)
* Experimental actor (A good night in Zerocity entails entering a vessel crowded with excrement-streaked sheep. Your role is to skewer their genetically-modified mouths for the audience's edification. The mouths are expressly designed to produce tender tongue meat. On holidays, a dead rabbit like a lost glove is added to the tableau. During leap years, the rabbit's paw rests on a child's broken bicycle.)
* Chris (Legend has it that only one being called Chris may exist in Zerocity at any one time. The city honours Chris by installing drawers behind the ears of The Holder of the Hallowed Name, festooned with gems. They are also granted the gift of the Blue Rose, enabling them to grow the eponymous flower from their index finger at will. Unfortunately, each Chris is also cursed to suffer a fatal encounter with a dead giant in their lifetime.)
